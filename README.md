Create an Android app using RecyclerView and an adapter that is able to look up a word in English and show its Kiswahili translations. You can limit the translations to 10 max if they are more available.

It would have been prefered to filter the translations by dialect and by likelihood/popularity but that data is not yet available in this database.

The rough sketch below gives you some idea of the UI where the first part is the input  and the second, consisting of a RecyclerView is the list of available translations. However, you can deaign your own UI. https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1575850/files/77774724/download?wrap=1

I have attached a sample data file which is a two-coloumn flat file.  You can use multiple activities or fragments for the UI.

Sample Kiswahili Database (Excel Format - You can export to plain text or CSV if you prefer) https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1575850/files/77774981/download?wrap=1

Submit by proving the Git URL (Github or Bitbucket) for the Android project repo
Keep to the deadline. It will not be extended.
